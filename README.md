# prog2-project
This is a Java project that search for images and will create an image viewer from the said images.

How it works: It'll recursively go through a given folder and search for any image file (png, jpg, jpeg, webp and even gif) then creates an html file for each picture and for the folder itself.
The "main" index.html will be placed in the root folder (the folder you gave for the main.java).

I uploaded a rar file that contains a folder that almost fully covers all the possible outcomes for the program, so you can test it out yourself!
(unzip before using it :D)

/The comments in the code are in Hungarian but it's main purpose is to give a little information about the main methods and functions./
